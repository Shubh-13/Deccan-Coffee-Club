        <h1 class="w3-center">About Us</h1><br>
        <h5 class="w3-center">Looking at the rearview mirror</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">Coffee has more than 400 years of history in India, a saga starting with story of 7 hidden
          seeds bought by Baba Budan from Moch port in Yemen and planted in Chandragiri hills near Mysore in early 17th
          century. (By the way, British brought tea to India around 200 years later, and we became up a nation of tea
          drinkers - but let‚Äôs not say anything more about it here üòä). Coffee has been a drink of choice for Indians
          from those early days, especially to the south of Vindhyas.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="w3-col m6 w3-padding-large">
        <h5 class="w3-center">The road ahead</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">India is today the 8th largest producer of coffee in the world, and there is a continuously
          growing consumption of coffee by Indian (mainly urban) population. However, due to the power of persuasion and
          continuous branding, we have come to associate coffee with some global brands and foreign names. We don‚Äôt want
          history to repeat itself, so this is our effort to popularize the desi brand of coffee as we knew in India for
          centuries. And believe us, there are more varieties of Indian coffees than people normally think!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="w3-col m6 w3-padding-large">
        <h5 class="w3-center">The why and the how</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">The aroma, taste, richness, and invigorating power of coffee is combined well in the Indian
          version of coffee ‚Äì generally called the South Indian Filter Coffee. Our objective is to take it pan India,
          and to make it the first choice of Indian coffee drinker. After all, ‚Äúfilter coffee‚Äù is easier on tongue than
          other coffee names we generally find difficult to pronounce!
          And it is not just the filter coffee at Deccan Coffee Club. We offer more different forms of Indian coffee,
          both hot and cold, a healthy choice of delightful south Indian snacks that are traditionally paired with
          coffee, and special healthy dishes that will be a custom made for you.
          We offer you Desi Taste, Dakshin Se, a treat to your taste buds that will also be light on your pockets!

      <div class="w3-col m6 w3-padding-large">
        <h5 class="w3-center">And who we are</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">Deccan Coffee Club is an initiative of a group of professionals, who had been colleagues for
          a few years and remained friends thereafter. We bring together decades of experience in operational and
          financial management in various industries and F&B business.
          At Deccan Coffee Club (DCC) we are just starting, but we intent to grow and expand fast by giving our
          customers quality and taste that will be remembered and repeated.
